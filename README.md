# üñ•Ô∏è Clean Your Desktop Script  

This is a Python script that helps you organize your messy desktop! It moves everything on your desktop into a new folder called "Cleanup Folder."  

## ‚ú® How It Works:  
- **Makes a Folder:** Creates a "Cleanup Folder" to store your files.  
- **No Overwriting:** If the folder already exists, it creates a new one with a number (like "Cleanup Folder1").  
- **Moves Everything:** Takes all desktop items (except the script itself) and puts them in the folder.
